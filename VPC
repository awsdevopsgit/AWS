VPC is virtual network dedicated to your aws account.
it is logically isolated from other virtual nerworks in your aws cloud.
SUBNET is the range of IP addresses in your VPC.
you can launch your aws resources into your selected subnent.
use public subnet for the resources that connected to the internet.
use private subnet for the resources that are not connected to the internet.
A ROUTING TABLE contains set of rules called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
each subnet in your VPC must be associated with the route table, the table controls the routing for the subnet.
A subnet can be associated with the one routing table at a time. but you can associated multiple subnet for the same routing table.
INTERNET GATEWAY is a horizontally scaled, redundant and highly available VPC component that allow communications between instances in your VPC and the internet.
It therefore imposes no availability risk and bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.
An IGW serve two purposes:
  Provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic.
  Perofrm NETWOK ADDRESS TRANSLATION(NAT) for the instances that have been assigned public IP addresses.
  DNS Hostname=FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name)
